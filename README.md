## Website Goals and Objectives
Increase Brand Awareness: Expands reach and reinforces Nando’s identity online.
Drive Engagement: Uses interactive content, social media, and email campaigns.
Promote Offers: Highlights new menu items, details about ingredients, and advertise promotions deals, increase the use of lucky draws among customers which will encourage  other to also visit the restaurant.
Measure Success: The main goal is to launch franchises in the Northern African continent; this will boost sales by at least 20% and will increase the restaurant’s recognition across Africa. To keep progress, there we will begin to check the online sales and the engagement of customers on the website. We will then ensure that the website will be fast and functional to decrease the bounce rate of potential customers and monitor the number of sign-ups.
